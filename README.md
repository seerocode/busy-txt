# BusyTxt Mobile Application

BusyTXT is a concept service and website created as a final project for an Intro to Web Media and Web Authoring course I took in college. I had prior experience with making webpages in high school and this class taught me how to use Dream Weaver instead. It was a total game changer for me especially since the application did almost everything for me in terms of structuring my pages and design. I pretty much just had to import pictures and after a few clicks I had a full-blown site.

Alas, Dream Weaver is dead and gone, and rightfully so. It is impossible to learn anything useful for the web today if you are using a crutch like Dream Weaver.
